**Maxima_residue**
============

A package for the open source computer algebra system Maxima.

- Contains the function residue_m and a couple of helper functions, meant to replace the built-in residue function.
- Fixs the long existing bug of producing wrong results for poles of higher order
- Adds new feature to support the computation of residue at certain types of essential singularites.

A work in progess.
